# My LLM Engineering Learning Journey

This repository captures my personal learning journey through *Ed Donner’s LLM Engineering* course on Udemy.

It documents my hands-on experience with Large Language Models (LLMs), covering topics such as prompt engineering, practical API usage, workflow design, and real-world applications built while progressing through the course.

Through this repository, I aim to track my progress, consolidate my understanding, and showcase projects and experiments developed as part of my LLM engineering learning process.

## Skills and Topics Covered

- Understanding LLM concepts and mechanisms  
- Prompt engineering and optimization  
- Building LLM-based applications  
- Designing structured LLM workflows  
- Debugging and evaluating LLM outputs  
- Integrating LLMs with APIs and simple pipelines  

The repository is structured by weeks, following the progression of the course, and will continue to evolve as I advance through the material.
